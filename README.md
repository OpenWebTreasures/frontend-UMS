## 1. Project Overview

This project aims to create a comprehensive User Management System that includes features such as user creation, role assignment, and secure access control. The backend is developed using Spring Boot, providing a robust and scalable foundation, while the frontend is built with React and TypeScript for a clean and typed codebase.

## 2. Backend Architecture

### Entities

The `UserEntity` class represents the core user entity with properties like first name, last name, and roles. User roles are modeled with the `Role` class, and each role can have a set of features.

### Roles and Features

Roles and features are defined through the `Role` class and the `Feature` enum, respectively. Features encompass various actions in the system, and roles are assigned specific features.

### Spring Security

Token-based authentication is implemented using Spring Security. Users are assigned roles, and access to features is controlled through a secure authentication process.

### Learning Journey

The backend development involved exploring and implementing various approaches, including DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), Mappers, Controllers, Repositories, and DAOs. These were employed to enhance code structure, maintainability, and database interactions.

## 3. Frontend Architecture

### React and TypeScript

The frontend is developed using React with TypeScript, ensuring a clean and typed codebase. This choice provides enhanced code maintainability and a more structured development experience.

## 4. Development Approaches

### DTOs and Mappers

DTOs are used for efficient data transfer between layers. Mappers facilitate the mapping of entities to DTOs and vice versa, maintaining a separation of concerns.

### Controllers

Controllers are structured to manage API endpoints seamlessly. They act as intermediaries between the frontend and backend, handling data flow and communication.

### Repositories and DAOs

Repositories and DAOs are utilized for efficient database interactions. These components ensure a streamlined process for managing and querying data.

## 5. Getting Started

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
3. Configure your database settings in `application.properties`.
4. Run the Spring Boot application.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with `npm start`.

## 6. Feedback and Contributions
